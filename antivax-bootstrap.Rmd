## Introduction

In a [previous post]({{ site.url }}/psych/bayes/2015/09/03/antivax-attitudes/) (I don't know why I'm linking it since there are only two), I presented an analysis of data by ([Horne, Powell, Hummel & Holyoak, 2015](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/33/10321.abstract)) showing changes in antivaccination attitudes. This previous analysis used Bayesian estimation to show a credible increase in pro-vaccination attitudes following a "disease risk" intervention, but not an "autism correction" intervention.

Some of my friends offered insightful comments, and one [pointed out](https://twitter.com/johnclevenger/status/639795727439429632) that there appeared to be a failure of random assignment. Participants in the "disease risk" group happened to have lower scores on the survey and therefore had more room for improvement. This is a fair criticism, but I found that post-intervention scores alone were higher for the "disease risk" group, which addresses this problem.

Still, interpreting differences in parameter values isn't always straightforward, so I thought it'd be fun to try a different approach. Instead of modeling the (process that generated the) data, we can use bootstrapping to estimate population parameters using the sample. [Bootstrapping is simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)) and is one of those techniques that people would've been using all along had computers been around in the early days of statistics.

The sample mean is already an unbiased estimator of the population mean, so bootstrapping isn't necessary in this first example. However, this provides a simple illustration of how the technique works: draw samples with replacement from your data, calculate a statistic on this new data, and repeat. 

```{r setup_bootstrap, dependson="setup_data", echo=TRUE}
numBootstraps <- 1e3  # Should be a big number
numObservations <- nrow(questionnaireData)
uniqueResponses <- sort(unique(questionnaireData$pretest_response))
interventionLevels <- levels(questionnaireData$intervention)

# The observed proportion of responses at each level
obsPretestResponseProbabilities <- as.numeric(table(questionnaireData$pretest_response)) / 
  numObservations
```

```{r pretest_bootstrap, dependson="setup_bootstrap", echo=TRUE}
# Bootstrap to find the probability that each response will be given to pre-test
# questions.

pretestData <- matrix(data = 0,
                      nrow = numBootstraps, 
                      ncol = length(uniqueResponses))
colnames(pretestData) <- paste(uniqueResponses)

# Run the bootstrap
for (ii in seq_len(numBootstraps)) {
  bootSamples <- sample(questionnaireData$pretest_response, 
                        numObservations, 
                        replace = TRUE)
  bootSamplesTabulated <- table(bootSamples)
  pretestData[ii, names(bootSamplesTabulated)] <- bootSamplesTabulated
}

# Convert the counts to probabilities
pretestData <- pretestData / numObservations
```

```{r pretest_plot, dependson="pretest_bootstrap", fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
pretestResults <- data_frame(response = uniqueResponses, 
                             bootstrap_prob = apply(pretestData, 2, mean),
                             bootstrap_sd = apply(pretestData, 2, sd),
                             observed_prob = obsPretestResponseProbabilities)
ggplot(pretestResults, aes(x = response)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = observed_prob), stat = "identity", 
           color="white", fill="skyblue") + 
  geom_point(aes(y = bootstrap_prob), size=3, color="red") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = bootstrap_prob-bootstrap_sd/2, 
                    ymax = bootstrap_prob+bootstrap_sd/2),
                size=2, color="red", width=0) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:length(uniqueResponses)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +
  xlab("Response Level") + 
  ylab("Proportion") + 
  theme_classic()
```

As expected, the bootstrap estimates for the proportion of responses at each level almost exactly match the observed data.

The failure of random assignment meant that the three groups of participants (the control group, the "autism correction" group, and the "disease risk" group) had different distributions of responses to the pre-intervention survey. To mitigate this, we'll estimate the transition probabilities from each response on the pre-intervention survey to each response on the post-intervention survey separately for each group. These are conditional probabilities, e.g., the probability of selecting 4 on a survey question after the intervention given that the participant answered 3 originally. Using these conditional probabilities, joint probabilities (e.g. probability of selecting 4 on the survey post-intervention AND 3 on the survey pre-intervention) are calculated using pre-intervention probabilities that are agnostic to group assignment. 

```{r posttest_bootstrap, dependson="setup_bootstrap", echo=TRUE}

# preintervention responses x intervention groups x bootstraps x postintervention responses
posttestData <- array(data = 0,
                      dim = c(length(uniqueResponses),
                              length(interventionLevels),
                              numBootstraps, 
                              length(uniqueResponses)),
                      dimnames = list(paste(uniqueResponses),
                                      interventionLevels,
                                      NULL,
                                      paste(uniqueResponses)))

for (pretestResponse in seq_along(uniqueResponses)) {
  for (interventionLevel in seq_along(interventionLevels)) {
    # Get the subset of data for each combination of intervention and
    # pre-intervention response level.
    questionnaireDataSubset <- filter(questionnaireData,
                                      intervention == interventionLevels[interventionLevel],
                                      pretest_response == pretestResponse)
    numObservationsSubset <- nrow(questionnaireDataSubset)
    
    # Run the bootstrap
    for (ii in seq_len(numBootstraps)) {
      bootSamples <- sample(questionnaireDataSubset$posttest_response, 
                            numObservationsSubset, 
                            replace = TRUE)
      bootSamplesTabulated <- table(bootSamples)
      posttestData[pretestResponse, 
                   interventionLevel, 
                   ii, 
                   names(bootSamplesTabulated)] <- bootSamplesTabulated
    }
    
    # Convert the counts to probabilities
    posttestData[pretestResponse, interventionLevel, , ] <- 
      posttestData[pretestResponse, interventionLevel, , ] / numObservationsSubset
  }
  
  # Convert the conditional probabilities to joint probabilities using the 
  # observed priors on each pretest response.
  posttestData[pretestResponse, , , ] <- posttestData[pretestResponse, , , ] *
    obsPretestResponseProbabilities[pretestResponse]
}
```

With the transition probabilities appropriately modeled, it's now easy to answer the question: "are participants in the 'disease risk' group more likely to respond with a more-pro-vaccine attitude after the intervention than participants in the other groups?" We'll use the previously-run bootstraps to compute the probability of *increased* scores separately for each group.

```{r posttest_shifts, dependson="posttest_bootstrap", echo=TRUE}
posttestIncrease <- matrix(data = 0, 
                           nrow = numBootstraps,
                           ncol = length(interventionLevels))
colnames(posttestIncrease) <- interventionLevels

for (interventionLevel in seq_along(interventionLevels)) {
  for (pretestResponse in seq_along(uniqueResponses)) {
    for (posttestResponse in seq_along(uniqueResponses)) {
      if (posttestResponse > pretestResponse) {
        posttestIncrease[, interventionLevel] <- posttestIncrease[, interventionLevel] +
          posttestData[pretestResponse, interventionLevel, , posttestResponse]
      }
    }
  }
}

# Calculate the probability that disease risk is greater than autism correction
sum(posttestIncrease[, which(interventionLevels == "Disease Risk")] > 
      posttestIncrease[, which(interventionLevels == "Autism Correction")]) / 
  nrow(posttestIncrease)
```

```{r posttest_plot, dependson="posttest_shifts"}
posttestDF <- gather(as.data.frame(posttestIncrease), "intervention", "prob_increase")
ggplot(posttestDF, aes(x = prob_increase, fill = intervention)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) + 
  ylab("Samples") + xlab("Probability of rating increase") + 
  theme_minimal()
```
