# antivax-attitudes
Data from Horne, Powell, Hummel &amp; Holyoak (2015). doi: 10.1073/pnas.1504019112

I wrote two blog posts about this. 

First, I used Bayesian estimation to estimate the size of the attitude shifts. You can read that [over here](http://eamoncaddigan.net/psych/bayes/2015/09/03/antivax-attitudes/).

Next, I did a followup where I explored how bootstrapping could be used to compare the interventions. This one is [here](http://eamoncaddigan.net/psych/r/2015/09/17/antivax-bootstrap/).

I *think* that's it for these data from me. Since this was my first time really diving into survey results I expect that I'll recycle code later. Please e-mail me if you have questions, or just to let me know if  you've found any of this useful!
